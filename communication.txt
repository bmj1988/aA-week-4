this is for a project that will never be read or submitted most likely, but the idea of the program is to try everything they put before me.

my style from the quiz is (A)nalytical

The last time I had a communication breakdown was with a friend who has been through
a very rough time lately. I had fault within the situation, and they were in an emotional
state -- the combination of these elements created a wall between us, and nothing could
pass over. Even the words we spoke were hollow, and by the end we were just ready to
abandon them.

I would say I generally communicate in a passive way because I like to listen to others,
and then when I'm inspired I am more open. I can trample a bit.

I like to be given general overviews, technical explanations when in non-personal conversations.
I want to be able to map out the problem or situation by what I am being told.

I usually respond to critical feedback with very little response at all. My immediate
emotional reaction is usually one of denial but I like to spend time with things. Unless
I know for sure that I am right and the criticism is wrong, I will spend time and analyze
the feedback to see if it provides me with an opportunity to improve.

Culture is the way people behave in a certain place, the way that a group of
people treats the endeavor they're involved in together. It is also the
idiosyncracies that build up when certain personalities interact. The germ
that grows between meshed up personalities.

Macy's: Relaxed but strained
C&J: Getting hard work done

I think what's important to me is remote work in terms of environment. I
can be happier with the people from work I do interact with, even if its
remote. And I can feel great about  my life and work.

Whiteboarding problem

Our problem or task is the creation of a counter function. This function
should start a counter at 0 and for every subsequent invocation add 1 to
the counter.

There are no edge cases, as there are no inputs. The function only adds one
to a counter every time it is invoked. I would solve this simply by
creating a Closure within the original counter function which increments
the counter variable by one every time it is invoked. The closure will
return itself to keep track of the counter.

const hiddenCounter = () => { // this creates the initial function
counter = 0 // establishing this counter variable at 0
const add = () => { // creating the returnd
counter ++ // incrementing counter variable
return add // return the function so that the counter variable is changed
}
return add // invoking the increment Closure
}
